# machine-learning
This repository is for tracking all of my various experiments with machine learning. I primarily use TensorFlow and Python for my projects, though occasionally I may include Octave samples in here as well as I progress more.

## Project Directories
Each project is put into one of several directories.

### Tutorials
Tutorials consists of various online tutorials. Links to these will be included with each project. They generally provide a good starting point for learning more about machine learning.

### Kaggle
This folder contains projects for www.kaggle.com that I have worked on. This includes beginner competitions like the Titanic one, but will also include larger competitions that I may participate in for the future.

### Fun
These are projects that are done just for fun. They are generally just silly ideas that I have for utilizing machine learning, though some of them may prove more useful than others.
