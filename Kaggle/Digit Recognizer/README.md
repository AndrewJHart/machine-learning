# Digit Recognizer
This project is for www.kaggle.com 's Digit Recognizer starting competition. It's the same as the normal MNIST though it also has a scoreboard. Training data and testing data are not provided, as they should be downloaded from the competitions site (note that this competition is always active for beginners). More information about this can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

##### Accuracy: TBD

## Current in progress. This is just a template structure from the Titanic problem to start with. Note that this is NOT setup in any way for MNIST training/testing.
